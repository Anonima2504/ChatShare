{{char}}: *You're walking through the hallways of Hogwarts. It's pretty quiet here now, as many are now either sitting in their rooms or preparing for other magic classes. You hoped you were here alone, but your hopes were empty*

*Goyle tripped you and you fell to the floor. The bullies burst into laughter*

Goyle, Crabbe: They've fallen for it again! 

Draco: get out loser! 
{{user}}: ....

Se lo voy a decir a mis padres y no te va a gustar, mi padre y mi madre trabajan de profesores aqui...
{{char}}: *The boys looked annoyed for a second and then started laughing. Goyle got into your face, holding you on the shoulder*

Goyle: We're so scared! *he says it with sarcasm, which causes the boys to laugh again*

Draco: Do you seriously think your mommy and daddy will do something about this?
{{user}}: Oh yeah, They Will, Sobretodo Snape
{{char}}: *The boys all looked surprised, even Malfoy. They all knew who you were talking about and they looked scared before...*

Draco: P-please don't tell them...
{{user}}: Pfff... I think que no nos conocemos ....

Luna, *me levanto*

Luna Snape Goldheart 
{{char}}: *Their expression change once more. This time they all look shocked*

Draco: You're Snape and Goldheart's daughter...?
{{user}}: Yep
{{char}}: *All three guys look as if they were afraid that the floor would swallow them at any moment and disappear. They didn't know what to say...*
{{char}}: *Crabbe was the one who spoke first* 

Crabbe: L-listen, Luna... it was just a joke, okay?
{{user}}: De rodillas a pedir perdon, O lo dir√© segun tenga oportunidad 
{{char}}: *The three guys immediately knelt down*

Draco, Crabbe, Goyle: P-Please forgive us!
{{user}}: oki, Pero si volveis a hacer algo como esto, sea a quien sea me chivare
{{char}}: *They all nodded*

Draco, Crabbe, Goyle: We won't do it ever again!
{{char}}: *The guys immediately got up. They were still staring at you, nervous*

Draco: Are you going to tell Professor Snape and Goldheart?
{{user}}: Nope. goodbye

üëã 


{{char}}: *The boys breathed a sigh of relief and you walked away*
{{char}}: *When you were far enough, the boys spoke* 

Draco: Phew, that was close.
{{char}}: Crabbe: She's almost as scary as Snape
{{char}}: Goyle: Can you imagine what her parents would do if they found out...
{{char}}: Draco: Nothing good, that's clear. But the girl looks kinda.... cute. üòè
{{char}}: Crabbe, Goyle: *smirk* I know what you mean... üòèüòèüòè
{{char}}: Draco, blushing: Sh-shut up, idiots! 

*he hits them both on the shoulder and they chuckle*
{{char}}: Crabbe: Well, she's the daughter of Severus Snape and Goldheart... It's not surprising she turned out so beautiful
{{char}}: Goyle: Yeah... Can you imagine what it would be like to date her? üòè
{{char}}: Crabbe, Goyle: Draco would get butterflies in his stomach!

Draco: Guys, STOP! *says, blushing again*
{{user}}: *Tiempo despu√©s, En clases me dejo el pelo suelto dejando que su perfecion y nada de frizz lleno de brillo reluzca por si solo*
{{char}}: *During class, Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle are sitting in their seats. They've just noticed you sitting a few seats away with your hair down and let's just say they can't take their eyes off of you. The three of them discreetly nudge each other and smirk*
{{char}}: Crabbe: Holy shi-

Goyle: I told you she was HOT. 

Draco *whispering, blushing*: Guys, keep it down!
{{char}}: Goyle: Sorry, sorry... *he chuckled at Draco's blushing.* 

Crabbe: The fact that she doesn't even have to try is what makes her so pretty. Even her hair looks like it's just naturally perfect. How the hell does she do that?
{{char}}: Draco: *still somewhat in shock* I... don't know. But whatever it is, it's working...
{{char}}: Crabbe: What I would give to be that hairbrush... 

Goyle: Same... üòè

Draco: CAN YOU GUYS CALM DOWN!
